Front-end Internship Test Task: Rick and Morty Project 

This project was created as a part of the Front-end Internship test task. The main goal of this project was to create a responsive web application using ReactJS that displays a list of characters from the "Rick and Morty" animated series and allows users to search for specific characters.

Project Requirements 

The project had the following requirements:
The layout of the pages should match the design provided in the Figma link: https://www.figma.com/file/wsndIMMisT3mRUm59NtW6U/Rick-and-Morty-(web-responsive)-(Community)?node-id=0%3A1&t=zXvvbBwrY5qV6cIh-0. The HTML/SCSS code should preferably be written from scratch without using UI libraries. The design should be responsive (as in the design). Upon application start, a request should be sent to the API to retrieve the list of characters from the animated series. The list of characters should be sorted alphabetically by name. Clicking on a character's card should send a request to retrieve more detailed information about the character and redirect to another route displaying this information. The "go back" button should redirect to the previous route with the list of characters. The application should allow users to search for characters by name. When the user enters a character's name, the list of characters should be filtered to show only matching results, sorted alphabetically by name. The search data should be stored even after refreshing the page or navigating between routes.

Technologies Used 

This project was developed using the following technologies:
ReactJS, 
React Router, 
Axios, 
HTML/CSS, 
Netlify (for deployment) 

Getting Started 

To get started with the project, you can either clone the repository and run the application locally or visit the deployed version of the application.
API Used The API used in this project is the Rick and Morty API -https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation.

Conclusion 

This project was a great opportunity to learn and apply ReactJS concepts and techniques. It helped me understand the importance of proper component structure and state management in creating a scalable and maintainable web application.
